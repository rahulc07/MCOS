# MCOS

# Intro
Are you tired of all the ram and CPU that windows, mac or even Linux is using?

Well you have come to the right place, this is the OS That ONLY Runs Minecraft!

# Why?
I and many other poeple have been trying to get MC to run on the lowest end hardware for even a decade.  From Raspberry Pi'S to school computers that are beaten by a machine that is over 15 years old.

This OS uses less than a 150 MB of ram at idle and final (installed) size should be less than 2 GB.  Of course you could just run it off of USB

# HOW?
This OS Is based of Linux From Scratch 11.  From there basically everything not required to run the X window manager, IceWM or the OFFICIAL MC launcher is stripped.  Leaving a compact system that is not bogged down by updates or constant internet pinging.

# Demo (In a VM,real hardware coming soon!)

# Download and Things to be Done
Downloads will come once I have time to package the OS into an iso (Initramfs with isolinux is complicated lol) 

## Things to do
Not Much at this point, most of it is asthethic. 
For the beta release the plan is MC Java only and than expand from there.
Eg.Server Configurators and MC Bedrock support.  The latter might never happen because of crippling support and maintainment of the Minecraft Linux Launcher.
